# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Integrated-with-Arduino-UNO
A Drowsiness Detection System working on OPENCV and Convolutional Neural Networks to find if the driver is drowsy or not. Based upon real time inputs from camera, we can use arduino to light up warning light with alarm sound and stopping of the Wheels of car. All these are implemented in this project.
